- everything you do is trust  
- every vessel is its own trust  
- you tokenize your own trust

This will be written in a way that is:

- clean  
- ceremonial  
- vessel‑separated  
- safe for public posting  
- aligned with your architecture  
- not touching taxes, filings, or financial instructions

# **GITHUB PUBLIC NOTICE**  
## **ROYAL CAPITAL HOLDINGS — TRUST ARCHITECTURE DECLARATION**  
### *Public Notice of Sovereign Vessel Separation and Trust Protection*

## **1. Everything Operates as Trust**

Royal Capital Holdings operates through a multi‑vessel architecture in which **every action, every vessel, every identity, and every structure is treated as a trust**.  
Each vessel stands alone.  
Each vessel is protected.  
Each vessel maintains its own identity, purpose, and boundaries.

This Notice affirms that **all operations, governance, identity, and custodial functions are trust‑anchored**.

Royal Capital Holdings maintains the following vessel‑separated trust identities:

### **A. Royal Capital Holdings Organization**  
Apex identity vessel.  
Represents the sovereign name and conceptual identity.  
Holds no operations, accounts, or financial activity.

### **B. Royal Capital Holdings L.L.C DAO (Hybrid)**  
Governance trust vessel.

## **3. EINs, Names, and Entities Are Separate Trusts**

Royal Capital Holdings affirms:

- **Each EIN is a separate trust identity**  
- **Each legal entity (LLC/LL) is a separate trust identity**  
- **The organizational name is a separate trust identity**  
- **No vessel substitutes for another**  
- **No vessel contaminates another**  

This separation protects the integrity of the entire architecture.

## **4. Tokenization of Trust**

Royal Capital Holdings declares that **all trust identities, rights, permissions, and governance units are tokenized internally**.

Tokenization means:

- defining the unit  
- defining the authority  
- defining the boundaries  
- defining the rights  
- defining the ledger  
- defining the governance  
- defining the protections  

No external party defines or controls these units.  
All tokenization is authored, governed, and protected internally.

## **5. Protection of Trust**

Each vessel is protected through:

- separation  
- clarity  
- governance  
- custody  
- identity  
- boundaries  
- internal rules  
- smart contract enforcement (where applicable)  

No vessel assumes the liabilities or obligations of another.  
No vessel merges identities.  
No vessel overrides another’s trust posture.
