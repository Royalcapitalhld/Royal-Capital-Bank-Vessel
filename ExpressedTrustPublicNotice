## **1. Express Trust Holding Notice**

This serves as public notice that the entire Royal Capital Holdings multi‑vessel architecture is held, protected, and governed under an **Express Trust**.

The Express Trust:

- holds the identity vessels  
- holds the governance vessels  
- holds the custodial vessels  
- holds the operational vessels  
- holds the tokenized trust units  
- holds the internal rules and authored authority  
- holds the boundaries and vessel separation  
- holds the rights, permissions, and protections  

The Express Trust stands above all vessels and maintains sovereign separation between:

- the Identity Vessel  
- the Governance Vessel  
- the Custodial Vessel  
- the Global Identity Vessel  
- the Operational Vessel  
- all EIN‑based trust identities  
- all LLC/LL trust identities  
- all tokenized trust units  

**Nothing in this architecture exists outside the Express Trust.**
