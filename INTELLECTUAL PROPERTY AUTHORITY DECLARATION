•	Identify goods and services
•	Your application must identify all goods or services that you have a bona fide intent to use with your trademark.
•	Goods and services are classified into broader categories called international classes. Your application fee is based on how many classes you list in your application. Learn more on our goods and services webpage.
•	The Trademark ID Manual contains a list of pre-approved goods and services. If you need to provide your own, you can choose to write your own identification for an additional cost.
•	Search the Trademark ID Manual to select your goods and services
•	Choose terms that the general public would recognize and use to describe your goods or services. Don’t select something that is just similar or "close enough." See tips and resources for finding an identification.
•	Can't find the right goods or services in the ID Manual? You can write your own identification for an additional cost. If you choose to write your own identification the cost of each class in the application will increase by $200, even if you selected some or all of your goods and services from the Trademark ID Manual. There is also an additional fee of $200 per 1000 characters that applies after the first 1000 characters.
