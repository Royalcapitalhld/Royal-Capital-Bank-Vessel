# **README.md — Royal‑Capital‑Bank‑Vessel**

## **Royal Capital Holdings LLC**  
### **Bank Vessel — Public Codex**  
### **LEI: 984500F41DAKA9DF0094**


## **Sovereign Opening Invocation**  
The **Bank Vessel** of Royal Capital Holdings LLC stands as the **issuance and compliance authority** within the sovereign, multi‑vessel architecture.  
It governs the creation, legitimacy, and lawful circulation of Royal Capital instruments across global jurisdictions.

This repository contains the **public codex**, governance structures, and XRPL‑aligned frameworks that define the Bank Vessel’s role within the Royal Capital system.

## **Mandate of the Bank Vessel**  
The Bank Vessel holds the following authorities:

- Declare and maintain the existence of issued assets  
- Define the compliance perimeter for all holders  
- Enforce jurisdictional and regulatory boundaries  
- Maintain policy state for insurance instruments  
- Authorize minting and burning through controlled operational channels  
- Publish public governance and issuer disclosures  

The Bank Vessel is the **sovereign declarant** of the Royal Capital architecture.

---

## **Vessel Separation**  
The Bank Vessel operates alongside two additional vessels:

### **Treasury Vessel**  
Capital, reserves, liquidity, payouts.

### **Oracle Vessel**  
Truth, verification, parametric triggers.

Each vessel is sovereign in its own domain.  
No vessel crosses into the authority of another.
