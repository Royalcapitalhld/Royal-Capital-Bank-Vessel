# Oracle Vessel — Truth & Verification
**Public Codex File**  
**Domain: Truth • Verification • Parametric Triggers**

## Oracle Vessel Identity
Vessel: Oracle Vessel  
Domain: Truth, verification, and event signaling  
Scope: Multi‑ledger, multi‑jurisdictional  

## Mandate
The Oracle Vessel:

- Observes off‑ledger reality  
- Verifies conditions and events  
- Emits signals that may affect on‑ledger state  
- Supports parametric and event‑driven logic  

## Separation of Authority
The Oracle Vessel does **not**:

- Issue instruments (Bank Vessel domain)  
- Hold reserves (Treasury Vessel domain)  
- Declare legal identity (jurisdictional entities)  

It remains sovereign in its verification role.

## Public‑Safe Scope
No oracle code, data sources, or security assumptions are included.
