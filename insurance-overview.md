# Insurance Overview — Royal Capital Architecture
**Public Codex File**  
**Domain: Risk • Coverage • Structure**

## Purpose of Insurance
Insurance, in this context, refers to **structures designed to manage defined risks**.

At a high level, this may include:

- Coverage for certain operational or structural risks  
- Institutional arrangements with insurers or risk pools  
- Alignment with governance and treasury structures  

## Principles
- **Defined Scope:** Insurance applies to specific risks and domains.  
- **Institutional:** Implemented through contracts and institutions, not the ledger alone.  
- **Off‑Ledger Primacy:** Policies, terms, and claims processes are off‑ledger.  

## Public‑Safe Scope
This file does **not** include:

- Policy terms  
- Coverage limits  
- Premiums  
- Claims procedures  

Those remain private and contractual.
