# Stellar Distribution Model — Royal Capital Architecture
**Public Codex File**  
**Domain: Distribution • Access • Reach**

## Purpose of the Distribution Layer
The Stellar layer supports **distribution** of instruments to eligible holders and venues.

It is used to:

- Reach broader markets  
- Provide access rails  
- Coordinate with custodial and institutional partners  
- Reflect distribution state on‑ledger  

## Distribution Principles
- **Eligibility‑Aligned:** Distribution respects policy and jurisdiction.  
- **Custodial Integration:** May interface with custodians and platforms.  
- **Transparent Balances:** Ledger‑visible positions.  
- **Interoperable:** Designed to align with XRPL issuance.

## Vessel Roles
- **Bank Vessel:** Defines distribution perimeter.  
- **Treasury Vessel:** Manages liquidity for distribution.  
- **Oracle Vessel:** May verify eligibility or conditions.

## Public‑Safe Scope
No partner contracts, routing logic, or operational details are included.
