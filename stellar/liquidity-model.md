# Stellar Liquidity Model — Royal Capital Architecture
**Public Codex File**  
**Domain: Liquidity • Distribution • Settlement**

## Role of Stellar in the Architecture
The Stellar layer is used as a **liquidity and distribution rail** within the Royal Capital system.

It is designed to:

- Facilitate cross‑border liquidity  
- Support distribution of tokenized instruments  
- Interoperate with XRPL issuance  
- Maintain vessel‑aligned separation of roles  

## Liquidity Principles
- **Bridged Value:** Assets may be represented across XRPL and Stellar.  
- **Controlled Channels:** Only defined pathways are used for movement.  
- **Compliance‑Aware:** Distribution may reflect eligibility and jurisdiction.  
- **Transparent Flows:** Ledger‑visible balances and transfers.

## Vessel Roles
- **Bank Vessel:** Declares what may be represented on Stellar.  
- **Treasury Vessel:** Manages liquidity and reserves (off‑ledger).  
- **Oracle Vessel:** May verify conditions for movement or access.

## Public‑Safe Scope
No bridge code, routing logic, or operational procedures are included.
