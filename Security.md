A SECURITY.md declaring the SSN ban formally
This is the strongest compliance move.
It:
- publicly declares that no SSNs, EINs, DOBs, or personal identifiers may ever be submitted
- protects you legally
- protects your vessels
- protects your architecture
- prevents contributors from violating boundaries
This is a public‑safe shield.
