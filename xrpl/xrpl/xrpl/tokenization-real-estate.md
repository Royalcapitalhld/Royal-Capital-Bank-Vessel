# Real Estate Tokenization — XRPL Representation
**Public Codex File**  
**Domain: Tokenized Real‑World Assets (RWA)**

## Purpose of Real Estate Tokenization
The XRPL layer may be used to represent **tokenized interests in real estate** or related structures.

These tokens are:

- Representations of claims, rights, or positions  
- Issued under the authority of the Bank Vessel  
- Governed by off‑ledger legal and custodial frameworks  

## Tokenization Principles
Public‑safe principles:

- **Legal First, Ledger Second:** Legal structure and custody exist off‑ledger; XRPL reflects representation.  
- **1:1 or Defined Mapping:** Each token corresponds to a defined interest, share, or unit.  
- **Custodial Clarity:** Underlying assets are held by defined custodians or structures.  
- **Compliance Perimeter:** Transfers may be subject to eligibility, jurisdiction, or policy state.

## Vessel Roles
- **Bank Vessel:** Declares the existence and legitimacy of tokenized instruments.  
- **Treasury Vessel:** May hold or manage tokenized positions as part of reserves or structures.  
- **Oracle Vessel:** May verify conditions (e.g., eligibility, events, thresholds).

## Public‑Safe Scope
This file does **not** define:

- Specific properties  
- Legal agreements  
- Custodial contracts  
- Internal valuation models  

Those remain in private, jurisdiction‑specific governance files.
