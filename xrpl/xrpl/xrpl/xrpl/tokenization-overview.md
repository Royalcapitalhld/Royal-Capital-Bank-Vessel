# Tokenization Overview — XRPL Layer
**Public Codex File**

## Purpose of Tokenization
Tokenization on XRPL enables **representation** of:

- Real‑world assets  
- Structured financial instruments  
- Rights, claims, or positions  

## Tokenization Principles
- **Legal First, Ledger Second:** Off‑ledger legal structure governs the asset  
- **Defined Mapping:** Each token corresponds to a declared interest  
- **Custodial Clarity:** Underlying assets are held by defined custodians  
- **Compliance Perimeter:** Transfers may reflect eligibility or jurisdiction  

## Vessel Roles
- **Bank Vessel:** Declares token legitimacy  
- **Treasury Vessel:** May hold tokenized positions  
- **Oracle Vessel:** Verifies conditions or events  

## Public‑Safe Scope
No legal agreements, custodial contracts, or valuation models are included.
