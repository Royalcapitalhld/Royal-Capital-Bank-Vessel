# Stablecoin Model — XRPL Layer
**Public Codex File**  
**Domain: Stability, Parity, and Representation**

## Purpose of the Stablecoin Layer
The stablecoin model on XRPL is designed to:

- Represent stable value claims  
- Maintain parity with defined reference units  
- Operate within a compliance‑aware perimeter  
- Integrate with vessel‑separated architecture  

## Core Characteristics
Public‑safe characteristics of the stablecoin model:

- **Backed Representation:** Each unit represents a defined claim or position.  
- **Controlled Issuance:** Only authorized channels may expand or contract supply.  
- **Compliance‑Aware:** Transfers may be subject to policy state and perimeter rules.  
- **Ledger‑Visible:** Balances and flows are visible on XRPL.

## Vessel Roles in Stablecoin Context
- **Bank Vessel:** Declares the existence and legitimacy of the stablecoin.  
- **Treasury Vessel:** Holds reserves and manages backing (off‑ledger, institutionally governed).  
- **Oracle Vessel:** May provide reference data (e.g., price, conditions, triggers).  

## Public‑Safe Scope
This file does **not** describe:

- Reserve composition  
- Internal risk models  
- Operational procedures  
- Smart contract or hook logic  

Those remain private and institutionally governed.
