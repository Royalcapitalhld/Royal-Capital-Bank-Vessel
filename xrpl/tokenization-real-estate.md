# Real Estate Tokenization — XRPL Representation
**Public Codex File**

## Purpose
Real estate tokenization allows XRPL to represent:

- Fractional interests  
- Ownership claims  
- Structured rights  
- Asset‑backed positions  

## Principles
- **Off‑Ledger Legal Structure:** Real estate exists outside the ledger  
- **On‑Ledger Representation:** XRPL reflects declared interests  
- **Custodial Integrity:** Assets held by defined custodians  
- **Compliance‑Aware:** Transfers may reflect eligibility or policy state  

## Vessel Roles
- **Bank Vessel:** Declares tokenized real estate instruments  
- **Treasury Vessel:** May hold positions  
- **Oracle Vessel:** May verify events or conditions  

## Public‑Safe Scope
No property details, legal contracts, or valuation models are included.
