# Smart Contracts Overview — Royal Capital Architecture
**Public Codex File**  
**Domain: Automation • Conditions • Execution**

## Purpose of Smart Contracts
Smart contracts in the Royal Capital architecture are used to:

- Coordinate conditional logic  
- Reflect agreed‑upon states on‑ledger  
- Support event‑driven outcomes  
- Align with vessel‑separated governance  

They are **tools**, not authorities. Authority remains with the vessels and legal entities.

## Principles
- **Vessel‑Aligned:** Smart contracts respect Bank, Treasury, and Oracle separation.  
- **Jurisdiction‑Aware:** Legal enforceability is grounded off‑ledger.  
- **Event‑Driven:** May respond to oracle signals or policy state.  
- **Representation, Not Substitution:** They represent logic; they do not replace legal agreements.

## Public‑Safe Scope
This file does **not** include:

- Contract code  
- Security assumptions  
- Operational procedures  
- Legal enforceability details  

Those remain in private, legal, and technical domains.
