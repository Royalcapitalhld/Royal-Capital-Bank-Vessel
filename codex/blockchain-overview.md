**Domain: Distributed Ledgers • Integrity • Transparency**

## What Is Blockchain
Blockchain is a form of **distributed ledger technology (DLT)** that records transactions across multiple computers in a way that is designed to be secure, transparent, and tamper‑resistant.

At a high level:

- Data is grouped into **blocks**.  
- Each block contains a **hash** (a unique identifier) and the **hash of the previous block**, linking them into a chain.  
- The ledger is **replicated across many nodes**, rather than stored in a single centralized database.  

This structure makes it difficult to alter past records without detection, supporting integrity and trust in shared environments.

## Blockchain in the Royal Capital Architecture
Within the Royal Capital system:

- **XRPL** is used as a blockchain‑based ledger for issuance and compliance.  
- **Stellar** is used as a ledger for liquidity and distribution.  
- The architecture is **ledger‑agnostic in principle**, but aligned with institutional, regulated, and high‑integrity environments.

Blockchain is treated as:

- A **recording substrate**, not a source of legal authority.  
- A **tool for transparency and integrity**, not a replacement for governance or law.  

## Relationship to Distributed Ledger Technology
Blockchain is one implementation of **distributed ledger technology (DLT)**—an infrastructure where data is replicated across multiple nodes to support integrity, transparency, and trust in distributed settings.

DLT and blockchain are used in the Royal Capital architecture to:

- Represent instruments and positions  
- Coordinate state across participants  
- Support institutional‑grade financial design  

## Vessel‑Aligned Use of Blockchain
- **Bank Vessel:** Uses blockchain (e.g., XRPL) as an issuance and compliance perimeter.  
- **Treasury Vessel:** May rely on blockchain representations of reserves and positions, while managing capital off‑ledger.  
- **Oracle Vessel:** May emit signals that affect on‑ledger state, but does not depend on any single chain.

No vessel surrenders its authority to the ledger.  
The ledger reflects decisions; it does not make them.
