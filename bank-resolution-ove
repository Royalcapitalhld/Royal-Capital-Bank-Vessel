# Bank Resolution Overview — Royal Capital Architecture
**Public Codex File**  
**Domain: Continuity • Wind‑Down • Orderly Process**

## Purpose of Bank Resolution
Bank resolution refers to **structured processes** for:

- Handling distress or failure  
- Protecting stakeholders where possible  
- Maintaining order and clarity  
- Aligning with legal and regulatory frameworks  

In the Royal Capital architecture, resolution is:

- Planned at the governance level  
- Coordinated with jurisdictions  
- Reflected symbolically in the codex  

## Resolution Principles (Conceptual)
- **Orderly, Not Chaotic:** Resolution follows defined steps.  
- **Jurisdiction‑Aligned:** Legal frameworks govern outcomes.  
- **Vessel‑Aware:** Bank, Treasury, and Oracle roles remain separated.  
- **Continuity‑Oriented:** Where possible, continuity is preferred over abrupt cessation.

## Public‑Safe Scope
This file does **not** define:

- Specific resolution plans  
- Legal triggers  
- Regulatory engagements  
- Stakeholder hierarchies  

Those remain in private governance and legal documents.
